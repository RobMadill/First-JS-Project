    <h2>WELCOME TO MY GAME OF ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS</h2>
    <h3>THIS IS HOW TO PLAY:</h3>
    <p> You will be asked to choose either: Rock (Press 1), Paper (Press 2) or Scissors (Press 3)<br>
        When you enter your choice and click OK, the computer will randomly choose Rock, Paper or Scissors as well<br>
        If you win, you'll get a point. If the computer wins, it will get a point. Try to get as many points as you can
        to beat the computer!<br>
        After each round, you will be asked if you would like to play again. If you decide to end the game (Click
        cancel), you will see the final score!<br>
